      <p>I am two-times Salesforce certified Administrator and Platform App Builder since 2017. On course of my carrer, I engaged with stakeholders to understand their expectations from technology and with best of my knowledge I tasked myself to guide and educate them for achieving the recommended best practices. I worked collorbration with Business Analyist and Solutions Architect in respect of development and deployment of the proposed end-to-end solutions signed of by business process owner. My priority has always been using out-of-box Salesforce functionalities however when it is required I am confident to deployment of code based solutions includuing lingtning components and apex programing.  </p>
      <p>My experiences mostly Sales Cloud and Service Cloud develepment; however, I have good understanding for Pardot and Salesforce integration. I am able to leverage both skill sets to create dynamic tracking and monitoring of end-to-end campaign influences and walk through with marketing and sales from lead generation to hopefuly closed-won opportunity. </p>
